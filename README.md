### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Carolina Steadham
#### I am a Software Quality Assurance Engineer with 13+ years in the field and I love what I do.


What is this Repository about? This project is the outcome of my self-learning about the API Testing Automation framework - Rest-assured. I heard a lot about Rest-Assured and how it made the QA's life easier by helping them to run all the tedious API tests in an efficient way. Hence, I started learning about the framework and have documented all my learnings in this repository with all example code from writing basic tests to running end to end API automation tests.
What does this repo contain? This repo contains example codes of API Tests using Rest-Assured. Hamcrest Matchers are used for assertions. TestNG Listeners are used to capture the events in logs. FAKE Rest APIs on Reqres.in is used for testing. ExtentReports is a reporting library for automation testing for .NET and Java. It creates detailed and beautiful HTML reports

Scenarios covered in this project:
GET requests,
POST requests,
PUT requests,
PATCH requests,
